# My grep
This reposatory is part of a small project I did in my B.sc in Elecrical engineering at Tel-Aviv University. The project is part of advanced computer laboratory about C programming. 

grep searches for PATTERNS in each FILE.  PATTERNS is one or more patterns separated by newline characters, and grep prints each line that matches a pattern.  Typically PATTERNS should be quoted when grep is used in a shell command. For more information on [`grep`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/grep.1.html).
